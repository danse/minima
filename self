I have working experience with Python and Javascript, and i've been using Haskell and Purescript for my personal projects. I care about good software architecture and engineering, i used different types of technologies and worked on the full stack along the years. I can work happily both alone or with a team, especially if there is a sensitivity for software quality. In general i can be rather flexible about the tasks i'm working on, but i always try to have a sane process and design the solutions before diving in
